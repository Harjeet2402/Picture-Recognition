# Picture-Recognition
Deep Learning project to identify whether the image given by user is a cat or non-cat. Using python language and machine learning models(mainly logistic regression) we created an algorithm 
to predict whether image is cat or non-cat. we first trained the model on a set of images and then tested it on another set of pictures to verify the accuracy.
